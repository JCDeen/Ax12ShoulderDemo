# Ax12ShoulderDemo
Improved versions of Robotis' SDK Dynamixel C++ Read_Write.cpp code.

This code, in its current form, is terrible! It works, but was obviously 
written by someone with more hardware skills than coding skills.

The error handling & messaging could be much more efficient. I will
present those changes here soon.
